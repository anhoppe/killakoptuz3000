How to compile LE3000 by anhoppe
--------------------------------

Do following steps in this order

1. Download and unpack wxWidgets 2.8.7 (or higher??)
2. search for file 'setup0.h' in wxWidgets folder.
3. relace the setup.h in the same directory where setup0.h is located (msw version, of course)
4. compile wxWidgets (open wxWidgets/build/msw/wx.dsp and compile). Compile both Debug and Release versions. Make sure that in the project settings under configuration->C++->Code Generation -> Run Time Libraries 'Multi Threaded (Debug) DLL' is selected.
5. copy the include directory with all files / directories to the ordner where this file is located.
6. Open LE3000 sln. Open globals.h and make sure that #define PRODUCT LE3000 (not #define PRODUCT KK3000) is inserted.
