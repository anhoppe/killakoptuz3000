= Game Ideas =

== Weaponsystems ==
  * Each vehicle a player can use should have several 'gun points' where diffrent weapon systems can be installed. So with many diffrent installable systems we get the kick of designing them in the gameplay


== Levelideas ==

=== G8 Mission ===
Protect the integer and beloved G8 world leaders by the necessary (or unnecessary) military force. No prisioners!
Distract them by dropping marihuana or fair-trade coffee. Merkel will cheer for each killed black-mob subject. Collateral damage is reqired (Shock and awe technique)

=== Possible Hostages ===
  *  OpenSource Programmers
  *  Bavarian killer gamers
  *  scientology members hunted by the vatican (later UFOs)
  *  The entiry US governmant from crazy G8-Enemies
  *  Chinese people from the Japanese
  *  Oil workers in nigeria from crazy natives incited by Attac (or a prominent person like Leonardo Di Caprio)
