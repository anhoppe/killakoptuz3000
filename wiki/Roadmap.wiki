#Project Roadmap

= Introduction =

Here, we will list the project targets for KillaKoptuz3000. Please try to write the targets as simple and clearly, as possible.

*Please

= Version Numbering Style =

In my opinion, the first playable version of the game should be called Version 1. Minor improvements and bugfixes should be denoted by an incrementing number after the main version number, serperated by a dot. E.g. Version 1.161 (Version 1, re-release number 162) 

I propose the same system for the leveleditor. (Fabs).

= Roadmap: Game, Version 1 =
*Graphics* with coherent style
*Music*, loopable
*Sound* effects
*Shops* between the levels
*Level targets*, necessary to complete the level (xml coded)
*Improved helicopter physics* needs to be, good balance of realism and arcade fun

= Roadmap: Leveleditor, Version 1 =
*Gui* programming
*Drag and drop* of grapical elements
*Save levels* as xml
*Level targets* save as xml
