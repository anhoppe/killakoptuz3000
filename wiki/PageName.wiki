= Introduction =

KillaCoptuz3000 Wiki includes game planning.


= Details =

We are some dump asses so lazy that we never thought to accomplish anything in live. But those days are over now: We decided to developed KillaKoptuz3000, *THE* (hey, bold is cool) kickass- motherfucking incredible 21st century shooting experience of the newest generation.

Featuring a choplifter like 2D realtime action simulation, you slip into the role of a heroic hrelicopter pilot, working for an incredibly responsible and environmental corporation that take orders from decent, broadly loved companies like Microsoft to rescue trapped OpenSource developers, among others.

Prepare to be blasted.

KK3000 includes very funny, very ambigious humor. If you feel insulted and want to sue us, simply consider that we meant it just the other way.
