CommanderZZ Code Blog - You will love it

= Introduction =

Here we present our development diary. Some sort of improved bible in the future.


= Details =

We started in 22th of april 2007 (new era 0, a.k.k.), this blog is created on 27th of may 2007 (or, as we like it, 0:13, 5. Feb 0 a.k.k.). You get it, pal?

== Sat/sun 26/27 May 2007 ==
Kyra (drained 1.5h with esoteric mambo jambo), Hoppe, Fabian


  * Added explosions to player and objects, first time we and the enemy (a nice little truck) exploded.
  * Created/found new problems with collision
  * Added shots to the player
  * When many objects are present the game becomes veeery slow. We'll have to improve that!

Hoppe, was still in the mood for ~0:45h

  * An object does not only rotate about it's own angle, but also around the parent angle, if it has a parent. That must still be done for the collision polygon

Fabian too...

  * CEnemy's can not collide with CObject's anymore, which allows them to drive on the ground

Fabian has done some small things after swimming in the Werdersee:

  * Damage model will be applied for all objects
  * Speed of explosion depends on object hitpoints. The more hitpoints the more buum. Formula is inspired by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis-Menten_kinetics michaelis - menten] enzyme kinetics.

Hoppe: Sunday, cruddy sunday...

  * I did stuff on the player gun: it stays attached to the player accuratly. The shots have a correct angle and start position (even when heli is flipped).

== Mon, 28 May 2007 ==
Fabian: in the morning nebula...

  * The player gun poly and rect are now rotated and flipped correctly
  * Discovered a bad thing: When two shots hit each other, the poly disappears, because both use the same polygon... (in CObject::isCollided) Ahhh. Possible solution:
  If (a_polygonAPtr == a_polygonBPtr) make a working copy of one... the code doesent get nicer by that. Tried it. It is too slow, because this case happens so often... Probably we have to give each object it's ony polygon again.
